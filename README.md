# SQL-Example-Work
Here you will find some examples of my SQL query's taken from practice problems. In this readme you will find a brief description of the scenario. In the raw code from each problem I have commented above each step to describe what I am doing.

Usage Funnels: This was taken from a project analysing marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates. I was given 4 tables and formed another that could later be used to calculate overall conversion rates or compare conversion between different steps (quiz, home try on, and purchase).

Calculating Churn Rate: In this project I looked into the churn rates of two different segments of users who were acquired through two distinct channels, in order to see which had the higher customer retention. There was a single table containing the data: subscriptions.

Marketing Attribution Query: For this project, I looked into which marketing campaign was most effective in getting customers to purchase. The information could be used to aid the decision of which campaigns are effective and should continue to be invested in, and which should be cancelled.
