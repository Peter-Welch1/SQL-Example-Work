# SQL-Example-Work
Here you will find some examples of my SQL queirys taken from practice problems. In this readme you will find a brief description of the sinario. In the raw code from each problem I have commented above each step to describe what I am doing.

Usage Funnels: This was taken from a project analyzing marketing funnels in order to calculate converstion rates. I was given 4 tabels and formed another that could later be used to calculate overall convertion rates or compare convertion between different steps (quiz, home try on, and purchase).

Calculating Churn Rate: In this project I looked into the churn rates of two different segments of users who where acquired through two distinct channels, in order to see which had the higher customer retention. There was a single table containing the data: subscriptions.
